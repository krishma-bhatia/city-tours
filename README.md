- Displaying travel tours being offered by a Tours and Travels Company
- Allowing user to delete the tours from the current session by clicking the 'X' icon on the image(which gets displayed when cursor is hovered on the image of the tour)so that they can focus only on tours they are interested in.
- Providing a brief description of the each tour by clicking the "Down Arrow" Icon on the tour card
- Providing a brief description of the Company
